                                       Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which this Company’s ethical

                                       Many employees regularly incur business expenses, which must be documented and recorded
                                       accurately. If you are not sure whether a certain expense is appropriate, consult the policy or ask
                                       your supervisor.

                                       Business records and communications often become public, and we should avoid exaggeration,
                                       derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies
                                       that can be misunderstood. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos and formal reports.

                                    <strong>Conflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions</strong>
                                    <p>
                                       A “conflict of interest” exists when a person’s private interest interferes in any way with the
                                       interests of the Company. A conflict situation can arise when an employee, officer or director
                                       takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work
                                       objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, officer or
                                       director, or members of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or
                                       her position in the Company. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, employees and their
                                       family members may create conflicts of interest. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of,
                                       directors, executive officers and their family members are prohibited.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       A conflict of interest almost always exists when a Company employee works concurrently for a
                                       competitor, customer or supplier. You are not allowed to work for a competitor as a consultant or
                                       board member. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business connection with the
                                       Company’s competitors, customers or suppliers, except on the Company’s behalf.

                                    <p>
                                       A conflict of interest may occur when an employee of the Company has an ownership or
                                       financial interest in another business organization that is doing business with the Company.
                                       These transactions between the Company and the other organization are characterized as
                                       related party transactions. While not all related party transactions are improper, the Company
                                       must be aware of the details of each such transaction so that it can make a judgment as to the
                                       appropriateness of the transaction. If you or a family member have any ownership or financial
                                       interest in another organization that conducts business or seeks to conduct business with the
                                       Company, you must report the situation to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and cooperate with the legal staff by providing all relevant facts. The CEO will determine whether or not the
                                       related party transaction is a conflict of interest.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except under guidelines
                                       approved by the Board of Directors. Conflicts of interest may not always be clear, so if you have
                                       a question, you should consult with higher levels of management or the Company’s CEO. Any
                                       employee, officer or director who becomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict shall bring it to
                                       the attention of a supervisor, manager or other appropriate personnel or consult the procedures
                                       described in Section 14 of this Code.

                                       mandated. Even within the Company, you should disclose confidential information only to those

                                       However, in some situations it is difficult to know right from wrong. Since no one can anticipate
                                       every situation that will arise, it is important to have a way to approach a new question or
                                       problem. These are the steps to keep in mind:
                                    </p>

                                          <strong>Make sure you have all the facts.</strong>In order to reach the right solutions, you must be as
                                          fully informed as possible.

                                       <li>
                                          <strong>Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do? Does it seem or
                                          improper?</strong> This will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with and
                                          the alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems
                                          unethical or improper, it probably is.

                                          <strong>Clarify your responsibility and role.</strong> In most situations there is shared responsibility. Are
                                          your colleagues informed? It may help to get others involved and discuss the problem.
                                       </li>
                                       <li>
                                          <strong>Discuss the problem with your supervisor. </strong>You are encouraged to talk to your supervisor
                                          about any issues concerning illegal, unethical or improper behavior and when in doubt
                                          about the best course of action in a particular situation. This is the basic guidance for all
                                          situations. In many cases your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the
                                          question, and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making process.
                                          Remember it is your supervisor’s responsibility to help solve problems.

                                          <strong>Report serious violations to the Company’s CEO.</strong> You should report serious violations

                                          or if you believe that the CEO has not properly addressed the violations, you may contact
