                                 annually to the Board with an assessment of the Committee’s performance. This assessment
                                 shall be discussed with the full Board following the end of each fiscal year. This assessment
                                 shall focus on the Committee’s contribution to the Company and specifically focus on areas in

                                    This Code is in addition to and supplements the other policies and procedures which have been
                                    implemented by the Company. If a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the
                                    law; however, if a local custom or policy conflicts with this Code, you must comply with the Code. If
                                    you have any questions about a conflict, you should ask your supervisor how to handle the situation.

                                    All claims of violations of this Code will be investigated by appropriate personnel. Those who violate
                                    the standards in this Code will be subject to disciplinary action. If you are in a situation that you
                                    believe may violate or lead to a violation of this Code, follow the guidelines described in Section 14
                                    of this Code.

                                          Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which this Company’s ethical
                                          standards are built. All employees must respect and obey the laws of all jurisdictions in which
                                          the Company operates. Any employee who is unsure about any aspect of these laws should
                                          seek advice from supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel.

                                          Accuracy and reliability in the preparation of all business records is critically important to the
                                          Company’s decision-making process and to the proper discharge of its financial, legal, and
                                          reporting obligations. All of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements
                                          shall be maintained in reasonable detail, shall appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions
                                          and shall conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of internal controls. Unrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets shall not be maintained unless permitted
                                          by applicable law or regulation.

                                          Many employees regularly incur business expenses, which must be documented and recorded
                                          accurately. If you are not sure whether a certain expense is appropriate, consult the policy or ask
                                          your supervisor.

                                          Business records and communications often become public, and we should avoid exaggeration,
                                          derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies
                                          that can be misunderstood. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos and formal reports.
                                          Records shall always be retained or destroyed according to the Company’s record retention
                                          policies.

                                       <strong>Conflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions</strong>
                                       <p>
                                          A “conflict of interest” exists when a person’s private interest interferes in any way with the
                                          interests of the Company. A conflict situation can arise when an employee, officer or director
                                          takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company work
                                          objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, officer or
                                          director, or members of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or
                                          her position in the Company. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, employees and their
                                          family members may create conflicts of interest. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of,
                                          directors, executive officers and their family members are prohibited.

                                       <p>
                                          A conflict of interest almost always exists when a Company employee works concurrently for a
                                          competitor, customer or supplier. You are not allowed to work for a competitor as a consultant or
                                          board member. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business connection with the
                                          Company’s competitors, customers or suppliers, except on the Company’s behalf.

                                       <p>
                                          A conflict of interest may occur when an employee of the Company has an ownership or
                                          financial interest in another business organization that is doing business with the Company.
                                          These transactions between the Company and the other organization are characterized as
                                          related party transactions. While not all related party transactions are improper, the Company
                                          must be aware of the details of each such transaction so that it can make a judgment as to the
                                          appropriateness of the transaction. If you or a family member have any ownership or financial
                                          interest in another organization that conducts business or seeks to conduct business with the
                                          Company, you must report the situation to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and cooperate with the legal staff by providing all relevant facts. The CEO will determine whether or not the
                                          related party transaction is a conflict of interest.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                          Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except under guidelines
                                          approved by the Board of Directors. Conflicts of interest may not always be clear, so if you have
                                          a question, you should consult with higher levels of management or the Company’s CEO. Any
                                          employee, officer or director who becomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict shall bring it to
                                          the attention of a supervisor, manager or other appropriate personnel or consult the procedures
                                          described in Section 14 of this Code.

                                          Employees must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the
                                          Company or its customers, except when disclosure is authorized by the CEO or legally
                                          mandated. Even within the Company, you should disclose confidential information only to those
                                          employees who need to know the information. Confidential information includes all non-public
                                          information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers, if
                                          disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers and customers have entrusted to us. The
                                          obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment ends.

                                          Company’s business. All non-public information about the Company shall be considered
                                          confidential information. To use non-public information for personal financial benefit or to “tip” others who might make an investment decision on the basis of this information is not only
                                          unethical but also illegal. If you have any questions, you should consult the Company’s CEO.

                                             the alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems

                                             about the best course of action in a particular situation. This is the basic guidance for all
                                             situations. In many cases your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the
                                             question, and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making process.
                                             Remember it is your supervisor’s responsibility to help solve problems.
